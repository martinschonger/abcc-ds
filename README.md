### Setup
Install MATLAB (tested with R2023a).

Install the MathWorks toolboxes
[Robotics System Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/robotics.html),
[Signal Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html), and
[Symbolic Math Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/symbolic.html).

Install the third party tools
[YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/) (version 20230622; changed sdisplay precision in PATH/TO/yalmip/extras/sdisplay.m LOCs 311, 313, 317, and 319 from 12 to 128),
[PENBMI](http://www.penopt.com/penbmi.html) (version 2.1), and
[GUROBI](https://www.gurobi.com/) (version 10.0.2 build v10.0.2rc0 (win64)).

> **Note**
> Make sure that the non-toolbox paths are before/on top of the toolbox paths.

### Usage
Open the `abcc-ds` folder in MATLAB.

Configure the desired experiments in `main.m` and run this script.

Check the `output` folder for results and logs.

(Optionally, recreate the plots from the paper with `plotting/generate_plots_iros.m`, and the animations from the video with `plotting/generate_plots_video_iros.m`.)
